      I'm a self taught developer looking to keep learning and gain experience
      with different tech stacks in a professional environment. My main area of
      expertise is in front-end SPA development using Vue.js, but in my current
      employment, I have also contributed significantly to our Python/Django
      based back-end, and always enjoy the opportunity to pick up new languages
      and technologies.
      <br />
      <br />
      In my free time, I enjoy dabbling with Go,
      and also a bit of Machine Learning.
