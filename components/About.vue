        I'm a self taught developer looking to keep learning and gaining experience
        with different tech stacks and methodolgies. My main area of
        expertise is in front-end SPA development using Vue.js, but in my current
        employment, I have also contributed significantly to our Python/Django
        based back-end, and always enjoy the opportunity to pick up new languages
        and technologies.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my free time, I enjoy dabbling with Go,
        and also a bit of Machine Learning.
